# GMG Anima Repository

### *Everything you make for your game will be under the "Anima" folder.*
### *"Unity GMG Kit" --> "Assets" --> "Anima"*

### Uploading Art
This can be done simply through the Github website and not Github Desktop. Make sure you are in the *Art* folder, then you can add a file here by simply going to the upper right of the repository.

Click "Upload Files" and it will take you to a drag-and-drop screen where you can drag and drop your art files into. 

Below the drag-and-drop area, there is a section called *Commit Changes*. This is where you can put the title and description of what you uploaded to the folder. These are more like comments so others can see what changes have been made (in this case it is just uploading art files and what kind of art you uploaded).

It will ask you right below that, to either commit directly to the main branch or create a brand new branch with your commit.

*Select the option to commit to the main branch*

Press "Commit changes" and you're done! Others will see the art you uploaded and be able to use in their own branches.

### Testing Spaces
Please make sure to use a branch under your name for testing.
It will be labeled "testing-" and your first name initial for your testing branch.

For testing mechanics, I included empty scenes under your first names in the *Testing* folder. These areas are spaces you can test any features or mechanics you want to put in the game. The *Test Level* is what I have made myself so far, and plan to test any future mechanics here.

### Level Creation
If you are working on a main level, go under *Scenes*, and there are scenes labeled "Level1", "Level2", or "Level3".
These are empty scenes, so feel free to make your levels there!

>***Important note:*** To avoid any future errors putting levels together, please communicate with each other on who is making which level and/or which puzzles in the level. Github will give merging errors if more than one person is messing with the same game objects within the same scene/level.

### Merging Levels into One Game
*We will do this later towards Demo Day when we finish all of our levels.*

Once we finish all of our levels, you can start to create a "pull request". This means you can put your branch into the "main" branch, where we will put all of the levels together to create our game! Since I'm the owner, I'll need to approve your levels before I can merge them into the main game.
